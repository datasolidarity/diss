# General Notes

Book: Cybernetic Revolutionaries 2011

## Analysis

I think this would be a useful text as Medina may give a clear line of explanation justifying the examination of the relationship of politics and technology. Even though it seems underemphasized, Medina does seem to also discuss the economic dimension of Cybersyn.

Overall, I think this book has more to do with *design* than political economic analysis. Yet, it also speaks to the history of studying technology in the academy, and intersection of management, cybernetics, and politics.

I feel this book might be useful to early introductory discussions in my own writing, both as an example of STS on socialism, but also as a resource for building out my literature review.

If I were to rank the utility of this book, I would put this in the pool of books that form background, but do not directly inform my work.

# Chapter Notes

## Introduction

Eden Medina begins her introduction with a framing question, "What is the relationship of technology and politics?" (with reference to writing a history of technology). She then introduces her subject: cybernetics in Chile under the presidency of Allende. Finally on the bottom of page 5 she begins to describe the Allende presidency's project itself, Cybersyn, or Synco in Spanish. Among other things, Cybersyn transmits current production data to the government from state-run factories. This data is then fed into statistical models to evaluate such things as factory performance.

The beginning of the outline of the book and the research project begins here (on the middle of page 6). Medina describes the background literature from history and sociology (of technology), emphasizing that 1) there is no dichotomy between the social and the technical, and as such politics are explicitly part of the history of (this) technology; 2) technologies are not value-neutral. Medina then describes her research questions:

> (1) how governments have envisioned using computer and communications technology to bring about structural change in society;
> (2) the ways technologists have tried to embed political values in the design of technical systems;
> (3) the challenges associated with such efforts;
> (4) how studying technology can enhance our understanding of a historical moment.

Medina continues by elaborating some terms and expands upon these questions. On page 8, she introduces a concept she herself conceives regarding "socio-technical engineering," the designing of technology, and, "the social and organizational relationships that surround it, to uphold a configuration of power congruent with the aims of a political project." (Note, she includes a citation here, which may indicate early work.)

Following Medina's research questions, we enter a new subheading on "Chilean Cybernetics." Here she describes a brief history of cybernetics and Chile's relationship with it.

Finally, she concludes with an outline of her book (p. 12). This book is written chronologically, and contains 6 chapters that range in topic from Chilean engagement with cybernetics and management; to political ideological influence on design; to Cybersyn's demonstrated utility; and finally to the larger historical context of the Cold War.

### Notes on the Introduction

While reading the Introduction, I found two things that stood out. First, for whatever reason, the framing of the fourth research question (top of p. 7) seemed relevant. Perhaps for my own work, I can posit my research as how studying data in the political economy can enhance our understanding our current moment (albeit within a material lens). How she justifies the specific examination of technology seems important.

Second, I found Medina's writing style to be almost journalistic, moreover, to the exclusion of other forms of thinking, she focuses on binaries, and seems to tend toward presenting both sides, etc. Given that her frame is to report a history, the reduction of issues to two oppositions seems useful, but perhaps reductive? The important critique to pull away here is not to take away from the extraction of  knowledge from the archive, or her responses to theoretical positions, but to open questions around her approach to analyzing and evaluating her research data. Yet, this may be a deliberate simplification for the purposes of the Introduction, I suspect.
