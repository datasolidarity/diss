# General Notes

in Castellanos et al. 2012 - Comparative Indigeneities

## Keywords

Afro-Indigenous, Haiti, Colombia, Indigeneity, Creole, Garifuna

## Impression

I think this will be a useful article to include in definitions of Indigeneity, and the complexity of defining such terms. Notably, although Castellanos is deeply involved in Settler Colonial Studies, this particular text does not really refer to settlers, or the concept of settling. It largely centers Afro-Indigenous peoples.

I feel like it might pair well with Robert Connell's work on Maroon Ecologies (see Connell 2020).
