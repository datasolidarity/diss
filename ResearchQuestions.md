# Introduction

This document collects some of my questions as I explore the topics of my research.

# Questions

Is the premise that we are witnessing an accumulation of data with unexplored consequences a legitimate question?

If and how does the current accumulation of data configure new opportunities for capital development, colonization, and resistance?
-   What kinds of value extraction was not available before, but has since become available for exploitation?
-   Of what opportunities for value extraction that was available before, but was nevertheless not exploited, is now exploited?


How is my research engaging epistemological questions (eg. views on Big Data being reliant on volume, see Dalton et al. 2016) versus a question of process?
-   It would seem to me that what I am examining is process over knowledge/meaning making, at least with regard to the growth drive. I am of course interested in what kinds of activities with data lead to threats on Q'eqchi' sovereignty and autonomy, but I am also trying to identify if and how it is an emerging and growing threat. For instance, the question of 'does data have value' in a Marxian sense is not addressing whether the data (and with it data science) sheds any light on knowledge making, at least publicly, so much as begin to examine if and how data is an object of accumulation.
-   This also makes me consider the types of data that are hoarded secretly versus the types of data that are publicly accessible, but a contingency for value production.

How important is value theory, ie. elucidating the value-relation of data, in understanding the accumulation of data?

What types of data are being accumulated? What industries rely on what kinds of data?

Where (in terms of entities largely) are data being accumulated?

Is data accumulation growing at the same rate of development?





If and how the current accumulation of data configures new opportunities for capital development, colonization, and resistance?

How Q’eqchi’ movements for sovereignty understand sovereignty, what Q’eqchi’ organizers view as threats to sovereignty, and subsequently, how these interpretations might confer a different approach to data sovereignty?
