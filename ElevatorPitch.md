# Introduction

An elevator pitch is an approach to explaining your research in a concise way. This is an issue with which I have problems, generally. In particular, it is difficult for me to justify my work in terms of its academic merits. By its nature, research projects grow and develop, so this pitch will also evolve.

The imposition of large extraction projects, industrial agriculture, and even state conservation and development programs in Guatemala are made possible in part by the data gathered about Indigenous peoples and their lands. Increasingly, much as elsewhere, data are collected automatically at scale, formatted for utility, and analyzed with sophisticated statistical techniques that are powered by growing and networked computational hardware. The data are now not only at higher resolutions and observed at more frequent intervals, but are also being analyzed more quickly and with a greater level of accuracy. AI and machine learning present new opportunities for classifying landscapes, categorizing people, or predicting productive output thanks in part to the availability of "Big Data." In turn, the extraction of surplus value in the process of capitalist development is increasingly structured by the quantity and quality of data at the disposal of institutions and enterprises. In other words, the logics of accumulation and dispossession rely on the accumulation of data. And the data being gathered, at least by its appearance, is historically contingent on this moment of advancing sensors and computation.
