# Introduction

An elevator pitch is an approach to explaining your research in a concise way. This is an issue with which I have problems, generally. In particular, it is difficult for me to justify my work in terms of its academic merits. By its nature, research projects grow and develop, so this pitch will also evolve.

# Elements

*   The research question: how the accumulation of data threatens Q'eqchi' sovereignty.

*   Data is constructed differently than in the past: automation, readability, scale, spatial and temporal resolution, novel senses.

*   Data is analyzed differently than in the past: AI and machine learning, powerful computational networks.

*   The accumulation of data is a process that combines the different novel aspects of data (above), impelled by profit and surplus value extraction. 

# Pitch

The imposition of large extraction projects, industrial agriculture, and even state conservation and development programs in Guatemala are made possible in part by the data gathered about Indigenous peoples and their lands.

Increasingly, much as elsewhere, data are collected at greater scales through advances in automation, formatted for computational readability, and analyzed with sophisticated statistical techniques that are powered by increasingly networked computational hardware. Due to advances in sensors, the data are now at higher resolutions and observed at more frequent intervals. Moreover, these data are also being analyzed more quickly and with a greater level of accuracy in terms of certain analytical objectives. AI and machine learning present new opportunities for classifying landscapes, categorizing people, or predicting productive agricultural output thanks in part to the availability of "Big Data."

In turn, it would appear that the extraction of surplus value in the process of capitalist development is increasingly contingent on the quantity and quality of data at the disposal of nation-states and other institutions and enterprises. In other words, the logics of accumulation and dispossession rely partly on the accumulation of a historically contingent data.

What is of concern for Indigenous peoples, then, is the potential that new forms of dispossession will occur as a consequence of this rush to accumulate data.



And the data being gathered, at least by its appearance, is historically contingent on this moment of advancing sensors and computation.
