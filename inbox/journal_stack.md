# Digital

In thinking about digital geographies, and how shallow of an understanding I have, I decided it might benefit me to have at least a map of the English (and possibly Spanish) language journals that consider something digital, from a humanities or social science position. I may consider building a map of the digital-oriented journals in computer science and engineering, but that might be exhausting and of little productivity given my inability to parse these texts. For now, I did a UCD library search of all peer-reviewed journals with the term "digital". 117 Results.

1.  Digital War (2020-)

    #Security #Operations #opsec

    Status: Active. Relevant.

    Note: This journal studies the digital technologies employed in warfare. Importantly, its young, like "Digital Geography and Society". So, a thorough skim should be manageable.

    Possible uses: questions around cybersecurity.

2.  Digital Culture and Education (2009-)

    #Education #Culture

    ISSN: 1836-8301

    Status: Active. Irrelevant.

    Note: As the title suggests this is largely a pedagogical studies journal. I can't think of a good reason examine it.

    Possible uses: building pedagogy, examining visions of digital space
