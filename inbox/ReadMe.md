The purpose of this inbox directory is to begin generating a list of things to investigate. In some ways, this is a TODO list. In this inbox, I aim to have a list for journals to examine, perhaps specific articles, correspondences to engage, etc. Much of the point of this directory is to include my cursory notes and ideas on specific materials.
