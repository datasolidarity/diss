# Introduction

In this document, I will begin organizing notes for a field statement as directed by the GGG handbook.

This field statement will be a review of scholarly literature in the field of Native American and Indigenous Studies. It must be related to my topic of interest, but broader. My advisor indicates that the field statement should be broader than a literature review of a specific topic, like sovereignty. Rather, it should explore all the major debates in superficial detail.

Topics may include:

See Teves et al 2015.

The remainder of this document requires revision.

# Approach to Literature Review

As I search through the literature, I will pay special attention to:

1.  The history of the field of NAIS (its origins)
2.  The important topics, debates, and areas of research (as a survey)
3.  Specific terms (see above, "Topics...")
4.  methodologies, particularly with reference to fieldwork.

I will begin with reference texts, anthologies and review articles published by recognized scholars in the field of NAIS, including from disciplines labeled: (Critical) Indigenous Studies, Native American Studies, American Indian Studies, and Native Studies. This list of articles will form what I call the "review pool".

Following this, I will read literature cited in relevant chapters and articles of the above. This list of articles will form what I call the "primary pool".

I will then continue by doing a search of literature with the keyword of sovereignty, focusing on the last decade. I will emphasize authors and articles with greater citations, but I will use different search engines to identify these. This will form my "contemporary pool".

While I recognize a field statement is supposed to approach a field as a largely cohesive whole, I will stray from this in two respects: to pull in important contributions from outside the above disciplines (eg Anthropology), but also pull international scholars as part of the dearly held tradition of hemispheric study. Regarding the latter, I will begin a search in Spanish-language journals with authors that I know cross over, including the likes of Cojti, Cusicanqui and Mignolo, published in both English and Spanish. From there, I will attempt to identify the discourses and publications that most closely align with NAIS, and proceed to study the subject of 'soberania' there. This will form my "tertiary pool".

# Approach to Writing

I will select a few authors in discussion, and move through topics thusly. As I am writing a history of a concept (or discourse), I will focus more on themes than individuals despite the aforementioned approach. Furthermore, I will attempt a crude periodization, albeit likely an amalgamation of periodizations and groupings from other authors.
